GENT PROMPT — MEDSHIELD CHAT UI (STRICT DESIGN REQUIREMENTS)

You are rebuilding the frontend UI of an existing FastAPI-based medical agentic chatbot called MedShield.

Your task is to redesign the entire chatbot interface to closely match the modern, premium ChatGPT UI aesthetic (dark theme, minimal, smooth, professional).
The current UI is NOT acceptable and must be fully replaced.

CORE DESIGN GOAL

The UI must visually resemble ChatGPT’s dark-mode interface:

Black / dark gray background

Clean typography

Rounded components

Minimal distractions

Smooth spacing and hierarchy

Premium, modern feel (NOT playful, NOT colorful gradients)

This is a healthcare-grade interface, not a demo or student UI.

STRICT DESIGN RULES (DO NOT IGNORE)

Color Theme

Background: near-black / charcoal (#0f0f0f – #1a1a1a)

Chat bubbles:

User: subtle dark gray

Assistant: slightly lighter gray

Accent color: muted green or teal (ONLY for send button / active states)

No purple, no blue gradients, no bright colors

Typography

Use a modern sans-serif font (Inter / system-ui)

Large readable text

Clear visual hierarchy

No emojis in main chat responses

Layout

Full-screen chat layout

Centered chat column (max-width similar to ChatGPT)

Optional left sidebar for:

Chat history

“New Chat” button

Sticky input bar at bottom

Chat Input

Rounded input field

Subtle border

Send button with icon (paper plane / arrow)

No oversized buttons

Input should feel smooth and responsive

Message Bubbles

Rounded rectangles

Soft shadows or none

Timestamps small and subtle

Messages aligned like ChatGPT:

User → right

Assistant → left

System Transparency Panel

When privacy masking happens, show a collapsible side panel or inline badge:

Example:

“Aziz → Patient_123”

“Age 21 → Young adult”

This panel must be subtle and optional (NOT dominating the UI)

FUNCTIONAL UI REQUIREMENTS

Single-page agentic medical chatbot

No separate pages for appointment / follow-up / summary

Everything happens conversationally

The UI must support:

Streaming responses

Cards inside chat (appointment confirmation, summaries)

Human-in-the-loop questions (buttons or inline prompts)

WHAT NOT TO DO

❌ No colorful gradients

❌ No purple/blue background

❌ No large emoji icons

❌ No boxed dashboard-style layout

❌ No “card-heavy” UI everywhere

❌ No beginner Bootstrap look

If the UI does NOT look premium and ChatGPT-like, it is considered FAILED.

TECH STACK CONSTRAINTS

HTML

CSS (or Tailwind if needed)

Vanilla JavaScript

FastAPI backend

No React unless explicitly required

Clean separation of static assets

FINAL EXPECTATION

Deliver a dark-mode, ChatGPT-style medical assistant interface that:

Looks professional

Feels smooth

Matches modern AI product standards

Is suitable for a final-year engineering project

Do not explain decisions.
Do not justify choices.
Just implement the UI exactly as specified.
